## 1. Architectural Distinction

### Master's Thesis Architecture (82% Baseline)
- **Quantum Layer**: Fixed random quantum circuit parameters
- **Training**: Only CNN layers optimized via backpropagation
- **Gradient Flow**: Quantum layer acts as fixed feature extractor
- **Parameters**: ~50K trainable (CNN only), 12 fixed (quantum)

### Target Publication Architecture (90% Goal)
- **Quantum Layer**: Fully trainable quantum circuit parameters
- **Training**: Joint optimization of quantum + classical parameters
- **Gradient Flow**: End-to-end differentiable through quantum circuit
- **Parameters**: ~50K trainable (CNN) + 48-96 trainable (quantum)

## 2. Critical Research Questions

1. **Gradient Efficiency**: How to prevent barren plateaus in quantum parameter optimization?
2. **Parameter Initialization**: What initialization strategy maximizes trainability?
