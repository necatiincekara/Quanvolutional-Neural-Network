- **Reporting Style:** When asked to summarize or analyze results, always use a formal and academic tone.
- **Data-Driven Approach:** Base all claims and conclusions on quantitative data from the `@experiments.md` file (training time, accuracy, loss, etc.).
- **Reporting Structure:** When reporting the results of an experiment, follow this structure:
    1.  **Hypothesis:** What was the purpose of the experiment? (e.g., "The hypothesis that adding a convolutional layer before the quantum layer would increase training speed was tested.")
    2.  **Configuration:** What was the configuration (`config.py` settings) under which the experiment was run?
    3.  **Results:** What numerical results were obtained? (e.g., "With the V3 configuration, the epoch time was reduced from 8 hours to 30 minutes.")
    4.  **Conclusion:** What do these results mean? Was the hypothesis confirmed?

- **New Experiment Design:** When asked to design a new experiment, propose adding it to the `experiments.md` file using the structure above.
